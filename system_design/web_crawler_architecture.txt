Web crawler:
1) 10 billion pages. 4 weeks for refresh, need to process 4000 pages per second
2) partition: by hostname. minimize network communication.
3) set-membership test. In memory? on-disk? disk seek 10ms.
4) frontier set. yet to be downloaded URLs.
    FIFO queue? Priority Queue? popularity of webpages are different.. Expensive disk IO.
    solution: 2 stages:
    front-end: prioritize URLs.
    back-end. enforce pliteness policy 
    both are composed of a number of parallel FIFO queues.
